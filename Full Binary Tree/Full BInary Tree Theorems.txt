Full Binary Tree Theorems
Let, i = the number of internal nodes
       n = be the total number of nodes
       l = number of leaves
      λ = number of levels

1. The number of leaves is i + 1.
2. The total number of nodes is 2i + 1.
3. The number of internal nodes is (n – 1) / 2.
4. The number of leaves is (n + 1) / 2.
5. The total number of nodes is 2l – 1.
6. The number of internal nodes is l – 1.
7. The number of leaves is at most 2λ - 1.
